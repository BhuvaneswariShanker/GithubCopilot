# SampleBootstrapApp

This is a sample project that demonstrates the usage of Bootstrap and Chart.js in a web application.

## Project Structure

The project has the following files:

- `css/styles.css`: This file is used to define custom styles for the HTML elements in the project.
- `js/script.js`: This file is used to write custom JavaScript code for the project. It includes a function to resize a Chart.js canvas.
- `index.html`: This file is the main HTML file of the project. It contains the structure and content of the web page, including input fields for income and expense data, and a Chart.js canvas.
- `README.md`: This file contains the documentation for the project. It provides information about the project and its usage.

## Getting Started

To include the latest version of Bootstrap and Chart.js in your project, you can add the following code to the `<head>` section of your `index.html` file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
```

This will include the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files, and the Chart.js library from their official CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) in your project.

## Usage

You can start building your web application by modifying the `index.html` file and adding your own HTML content. Use the Bootstrap classes and components to style and structure your web page. Use the Chart.js library to create and manipulate charts.

Feel free to customize the styles in the `css/styles.css` file and add your own JavaScript code in the `js/script.js` file to enhance the functionality of your web application.
